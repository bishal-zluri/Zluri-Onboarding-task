Reasons to choose Postgres over MongoDb:

1. Efficient Relational joins:
To find status of a group, we need to find status of each and every user and for that, 
we can use relational joins by postgres to efficiently find user status using joins in postgres.

2. Schema enforcement for the record:
The objective of the pipeline is to produce a reconciled, high-quality dataset with a 
consistent structure (group_id, status, user_ids, timestamps). PostgreSQL enforces strict 
data typing and schema definitions. This ensures that the final data serving layer remains clean 
and predictable, preventing malformed data (which might easily slip into a schema-less document store) from entering the system.

3. Easy access to data:
Can use DB query to access the data easily.
