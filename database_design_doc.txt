Pros/Cons to choose Postgres:

Pros:
1. In UserRoles join table, the user_id - role_id mapping is a primary key, so if a role_id gets deleted from Roles table,
then beacuse of ON DELETE CASCADE, the mapping of user_id - role_id gets deleted easily and for this Postgres is better.

Now other scenerio, would have been to store the roles_id as array[] but for that if any role_id gets deleted 
from Roles table, then we would have to traverse through the user tables and delete each role_id that is deleted from 
roles table.

2. This is applicable for all other join present in the schema

Cons:
In MongoDb, if we store the role_ids as array[], then accessing them becomes easier and we can delete them as well if 
any role_id gets deleted from Roles table
